# About Fathom

Fathom Protocol is a decentralized finance ecosystem built on the XDC network. The Protocol's purpose is to increase the liquidity of the XDC network and make FXD, over-collateralized and soft-pegged Stablecoin, a central part of the XDC network DeFi ecosystem.

The Fathom Protocol is designed to be the focal point for all DeFi needs on the XDC network, providing a secure decentralized environment for users to deploy their assets in various ways. With our innovative solutions, Fathom Protocol will play a crucial role in the future of DeFi and the XDC Network.
